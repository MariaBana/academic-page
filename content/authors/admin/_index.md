I am an incoming M.Phil student at HKUST(gz) and also is a research assistant at [IIIS, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), under the supervise of [Prof. Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/). 

My research interests include **Robotics**, **Optimal Control**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. I am passionate about exploring the potential of robots and how they can be utilized to improve our lives. 

During my undergraduate studies, I focused on robotic competitions and developed [many interesting robots](#projects). Now, I am shifting my passion towards research. Stay tuned for more updates!
